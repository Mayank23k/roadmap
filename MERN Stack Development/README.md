# Roadmap to become a Mern Stack Developer

[ **M** = "MongoDB", **E** = "ExpressJS", **R** = "React", **N** = "NodeJS"]

Nodejs and Express is used to build the backend, React is used to build the frontend and MongoDB is used as the database. MERN stack has become very popular as it is very easy and fast to build applications.

The roadmap can be broadly classified into 4 parts:

- Getting started with frontend development (HTML, CSS, JS)
- Learning React
- Learning Express.js and MongoDB
- Building projects

Let’s look at each of them in detail.

# Learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript

HTML, CSS and JavaScript are at the core of all websites.

- HTML provides the basic structure.
- CSS provides the skin to the structure in the form of design, formatting, and layout.
- JavaScript adds interactivity and logic to the website.

## Things to keep in mind

- Start with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Do not directly jump to learning React or other frameworks/libraries.
- CSS is difficult but is something that you should learn well. Do not directly jump to using Tailwind or Bootstrap.
- Do not wait to complete JS before starting to build projects. JS is huge and takes time to learn.
- Most companies have UI Machine Coding Round for frontend development roles where you cannot use any framework/library.

# Learn React

React is one of the most used frontend libraries in tech companies. Almost all the modern tech companies from early-stage startups to the biggest tech companies like Microsoft and Facebook use React.

## Things to keep in mind

- Do not wait to learn React completely before you start using it. Build something or solve assignments while learning.
- React has a very big community and is being actively built by Facebook and the community. It is not going anywhere so you can safely bet on it.

# Learn Backend using Express and MongoDB

Node + Express forms the N and E of the MERN stack. Most big companies use Java or Java-like languages for the backend. Most startups use Python or Node + Express for the backend.

Express helps build the backend very easily while staying in JavaScript ecosystem. It is preferred for self-projects as it helps focus on learning development and building projects pretty fast.

MongoDB is one of the most popular NoSQL databases. It forms the M of the MERN stack and works pretty well with the JS ecosystem.

# Build Projects

Learning languages and technologies is not enough if you can’t use it to build something.

Most students get stuck in tutorial hell while learning development. Tutorial hell means watching tutorials and building whatever the instructor is building and continuing doing that across tutorials without actually building anything outside that.

## Project Ideas

- E-commerce website
- Food Delivery App
- Social Media App
- Chat Messaging App
- Content Management System
- Blog Site
- Workout Tracker App
- Project Management Dashboard

HAPPY LEARNING!
